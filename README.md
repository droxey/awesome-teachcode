## Diagramming

* **[sketchboard.io](sketchboard.io)**: Sketch software architectures, flow diagrams, mind maps, and more. Can share with the public and embed in lesson plans.

## Feedback

* **[Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com)**: Engage your class in real-time. Poll Everywhere transforms one-sided presentations into two-way conversations with an audience. This web-based audience response system lets you embed interactive activities directly into your presentation. The audience responds on the web or via SMS texting on their phones.

## Grading 

* **[gitinspector](https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector))**: Statistical analysis tool for git repositories. The default analysis shows general statistics per author, which can be complemented with a timeline analysis that shows the workload and activity of each author. Under normal operation, it filters the results to only show statistics about a number of given extensions and by default only includes source files in the statistical analysis.

* **[degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)**: Makes copies of git repositories. Run `degit some-user/some-repo`, and degit will find the latest commit on https://github.com/some-user/some-repo and download the associated tar file to `~/.degit/some-user/some-repo/commithash.tar.gz` if it doesn't already exist locally. 

## Presentations

* **[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)**: Framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. Features include nested slides, Markdown contents, PDF export, speaker notes and a JavaScript API. Use in conjunction with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for public, sharable, and open source presentations.

* **[reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)**: [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) on steroids! Get beautiful reveal.js presentations from Markdown files.

## Recording

* **[asciinema](https://asciinema.org)**: A free and open source solution for recording terminal sessions and sharing them on the web.

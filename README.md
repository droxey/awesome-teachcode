## Community 

* **[dev.to](https://dev.to)**: Where programmers share ideas and help each other grow. An online community for sharing and discovering great ideas, having debates, and making friends. Anyone can share articles, questions, discussions, etc. as long as they have the rights to the words they are sharing. Cross-posting from your own blog is welcome.

* **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)**: An all-in-one workflow that combines global deployment, continuous integration, and automatic HTTPS. 

## Diagramming

## Feedback

* **[Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com)**: Engage your class in real-time. Poll Everywhere transforms one-sided presentations into two-way conversations with an audience. This web-based audience response system lets you embed interactive activities directly into your presentation. The audience responds on the web or via SMS texting on their phones.

## Grading 

* **[gitinspector](https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector)**: Statistical analysis tool for git repositories. The default analysis shows general statistics per author, which can be complemented with a timeline analysis that shows the workload and activity of each author. Under normal operation, it filters the results to only show statistics about a number of given extensions and by default only includes source files in the statistical analysis.
* **[degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)**: Makes copies of git repositories. Run `degit some-user/some-repo`, and degit will find the latest commit on https://github.com/some-user/some-repo and download the associated tar file to `~/.degit/some-user/some-repo/commithash.tar.gz` if it doesn't already exist locally. 

## Learning Objectives

* **[List of Measurable Verbs](https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml)**: A list of measurable verbs to assist you in writing course objectives and assess learning outcomes.
* **[Objectives Builder](http://teachonline.asu.edu/objectives-builder/)**: Use the ASU Online Objectives Builder tool to write measurable course outcomes and learning objectives.

## Presentations

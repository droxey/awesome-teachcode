_24 inch dual 4K monitors for extra screen real estate while streaming._

_**Note**: Any 720p webcam capable of at least 30 fps will improve the quality of your videos significantly. If you are unable to find a webcam in stock, consider using your smartphone's camera by setting up an NDI device in OBS._

- **720p Streaming**: Stream in 720p resolution @ 60 fps to maintain visual fidelity. 720p @ 60fps is the max resolution most streaming services will allow.
- **1080p Recording**: Record streams in 1080p using OBS.
- **Ring Light**: Maintains even and flattering light and reduces harsh shadows. Can be manually adjusted by twisting the light.
- **Auto Focus**: Sharp, precise, seamless footage; reduces motion blur.
